Welcome to TABS!
=================

TABS stands for Torsion Angular Bin Strings and is a discrete vector representation
of a conformer's torsional angles. 
Through this discretization, conformational states can be counted, yielding in an estimate of the upper limit of the expected conformational ensemble
size (nTABS). 

:ref:`Get started <GetStarted>` by installing the TABS package and learn how to use it.
